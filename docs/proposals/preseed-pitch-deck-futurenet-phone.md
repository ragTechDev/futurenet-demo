# FutureNet Phone — Pre-Seed Investor Pitch Deck (UPDATED)

**Hybrid Kickstarter + School Pilot Strategy**

---

## Slide 1 — Cover

**FutureNet Phone**

The school-approved smartphone for Singapore families

Pre-seed deck — January 2026

---

## Slide 2 — Problem

Singapore parents face an impossible choice:

> "I want my child to be reachable, but I don't want to hand them the entire internet."  
> — Parent of 13-year-old, Sec 1

**The dilemma**:

- Schools ban smartphones (distraction, social media, academic integrity)
- But parents need to reach their kids (logistics, safety, emergencies)
- Existing solutions fail:
  - **Mainstream phones + Screen Time**: bypassable, high parent effort, not school-verifiable
  - **Watches/trackers**: don't meet teen expectations for a "real phone"
  - **International "healthy phones"**: not available in Singapore, not aligned to local school policies

**Result**: Parents either:
1. Give in and buy a smartphone (school non-compliance, distraction risk)
2. Hold out with no device (safety concerns, logistics friction)

---

## Slide 3 — Parent personas (from Singapore research)

We interviewed 20+ Singapore parents. Three recurring personas:

**The Pragmatist** (40%)
- "I need to reach my child after school, but I don't want them scrolling TikTok in class."
- Wants: reachability + school compliance
- Pain: Screen Time is bypassable; schools won't endorse mainstream phones

**The Safety-First Parent** (35%)
- "What if there's an emergency and I can't reach them?"
- Wants: SOS button, location (opt-in), reliable calls/SMS
- Pain: Watches don't feel like "real phones" to teens; adoption resistance

**The Gradualist** (25%)
- "I want to teach digital responsibility step-by-step, not all-or-nothing."
- Wants: graduated access (start with calls/SMS, add apps over time)
- Pain: No product supports phased autonomy; it's either full smartphone or nothing

---

## Slide 4 — Solution

**FutureNet Phone**: A parent-owned, school-compliant smartphone for Singapore teens.

**Core features**:

1. **School Mode** (auto-activates during school hours)
   - Locks device to calls/SMS only (whitelisted contacts)
   - No browser, no social media, no games
   - Optional educator override (teacher can unlock for approved use)

2. **Parent-managed device** (Android Enterprise Device Owner)
   - Strong enforcement (not bypassable via VPN, hidden apps, or factory reset)
   - Parent portal for policy management
   - Graduated access (add apps as child matures)

3. **School compliance verifier**
   - Schools can verify device is policy-compliant (one-click check)
   - School templates for common policies
   - Institutional-grade credibility

4. **SIM-unlocked, parent-owned**
   - Not tied to telco contracts
   - Parents choose carrier and plan
   - Device ownership stays with family

---

## Slide 5 — Why now?

**Convergence of three trends**:

1. **Singapore schools tightening phone policies** (2023–2024)
   - More schools banning smartphones outright
   - Parents asking: "What's the compliant alternative?"

2. **Proven international demand** (US, UK, Japan, Korea)
   - WisePhone (US): $500K+ Kickstarter, subscription model works
   - Sage (UK): Managed iPhone model, strong parent adoption
   - Kiwi Plus (Korea): Telco-integrated kids phone, 100K+ users
   - **Gap**: No Singapore-localized, school-first solution

3. **Singapore government pushing digital literacy + device subsidies**
   - MOE Personal Learning Device (PLD) program: Edusave-funded devices for students
   - Precedent for school-approved, subsidized devices
   - Opportunity: Position FutureNet as Edusave-eligible "communication device"

---

## Slide 6 — Competitor landscape

| Product | SG available today | School Mode concept | Verifiable compliance for schools | Browser-free by design | No WhatsApp (v1 stance) | Strong parent admin | Location + safe zones | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FutureNet Phone (proposed)** | **Yes (launch in SG)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | (optional/SOS-first) | Built for a government/MOE-first country; school templates + compliance verifier. |
| WisePhone (US) | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | DTC healthy smartphone; not SG-localized; not designed as a school-verifiable compliance device. |
| Sage (UK) | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Managed iPhone model; app catalog includes WhatsApp; not positioned around SG school compliance. |
| Karri (UK) | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Screen-free comms + GPS; doesn't meet teen expectations of a phone experience. |
| BoT Talk (US) | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Screen-free GPS + voice; not a school-compliant smartphone alternative for teens. |
| Docomo Kids Keitai (JP) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Strong telco-integrated kids line; Japan-specific distribution/regulatory context. |
| KDDI mamorino (JP) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Kids watch/phone model; Japan-specific distribution/regulatory context. |
| Kiwi Plus / LG U+ Kids Phone (KR) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | Telco kids smartphone + guardian app + character UX; Korea telco distribution model. |

**Key insight**: International competitors have proven demand, but none are Singapore-available or school-compliance-first.

## Slide 7 — Technical approach

We leverage **proven enterprise device management** (not custom hardware/OS):

**Android Enterprise Device Owner mode**:
- System-level control (stronger than parental control apps)
- Prevents bypass via VPN, hidden apps, safe mode, factory reset
- Zero-touch enrollment (devices ship pre-configured)

**Samsung Knox Configure** (MDM):
- Used by LG U+ Kids Phone (Korea) with 100K+ users
- Cost-effective (S$15/year per device)
- Enables custom launcher, app allowlist, School Mode automation

**Why this works**:
- No need to build custom hardware or OS (capital-efficient)
- Proven at scale (enterprise + consumer use cases)
- Strong enforcement (institutional-grade security)

---

## Slide 8 — Market size

**Singapore secondary school students**: ~180,000 (Sec 1–5)

**Beachhead**: Sec 1–2 students (ages 13–14) = ~70,000 students

**Serviceable market** (conservative):
- 20% of Sec 1–2 families adopt (early adopter + pragmatist segments) = **14,000 devices**
- Average device price: S$270
- Average subscription: S$10/month × 36 months = S$360
- **Total addressable**: S$3.8M (devices) + S$5M (subscriptions) = **S$8.8M**

**Expansion**:
- Upper primary transition segment (10–12 years old): +50,000 students
- Additional geographies with similar school restrictions (Malaysia, Hong Kong)
- Additional product tiers (graduated access, approved app catalog, safe messaging)

---

## Slide 9 — Business model (hybrid funding strategy)

We combine **VC funding + Kickstarter revenue** to reduce dilution and validate demand early.

### Funding sources

**1. Pre-seed VC: S$250K** (this raise)
- Funds product development, Kickstarter campaign, school pilot, founder salaries

**2. Kickstarter: S$80K–S$120K** (Month 3)
- Funds device inventory for B2C cohort
- Validates consumer willingness to pay

**Total capital**: S$330K–S$370K

### Revenue model

**Upfront device sale** (covers hardware + initial provisioning)
- Tier 1 (Full retail): **S$270** (competitive with budget smartphones)
- Tier 2 (Edusave-eligible): **S$220–S$250** (Edusave-subsidized)
- Tier 3 (Subsidized): **S$150–S$180** (MOE FAS)

**Why S$270 works**:
- **Competitive positioning**: Comparable to budget Android phones (Samsung A-series ~S$300–S$400)
- **Easy parent decision**: Lower than mainstream smartphones, but delivers school compliance
- **Edusave makes it compelling**: With Edusave subsidy, out-of-pocket cost drops to S$0–S$50 for most families
- **No-brainer vs. alternatives**: Mainstream phone (S$400+) + ongoing enforcement hassle vs. FutureNet (S$270) + peace of mind

**Recurring subscription** (covers MDM licensing, support, policy updates, warranty)
- S$10–S$12/month (or S$100–S$120/year)

**Why this works**:
- **Edusave compatibility** positions us alongside approved school devices (calculators, PLDs)
- **Kickstarter** validates B2C demand without waiting for schools
- **School partnerships** build institutional moat for long-term defensibility
- Device is **SIM-unlocked** (no telco lock-in; parents choose carrier)

---

## Slide 10 — Unit economics (detailed)

### Cost structure (per device)

**Hardware COGS**
- Base device (refurbished Samsung A-series): **~S$80** (pilot) → **~S$150** (commercial)
- Accessories (case, screen protector, packaging): **~S$20**
- **Total hardware (pilot)**: **~S$100**

**MDM + software (annual per device)**
- Samsung Knox Configure license: **~S$15/year** (~USD $10–12)
- Backend hosting + SMS (SOS): **~S$8/year**
- **Total software**: **~S$23/year** (~S$2/month)

**One-time provisioning**
- Zero-touch enrollment setup + QA: **~S$10/device**

**Ongoing ops (annual per device)**
- Support (estimated 0.3 tickets/device/week → ~15 tickets/year): **~S$30/year**
- Warranty replacements (estimated 5% failure rate): **~S$10/year**
- Logistics (shipping, returns): **~S$5/year**

### Unit economics at scale (1,000 devices)

**Device margin** (Tier 1 retail: S$270 device bundle)
- Revenue: S$270
- Cost: S$150 (hardware) + S$10 (provisioning) = S$160
- **Gross margin: S$110 (41%)**

**Subscription margin** (S$10/month = S$120/year)
- Revenue: S$120/year
- Cost: S$23 (MDM/software) + S$30 (support) + S$10 (warranty) + S$5 (logistics) = S$68/year
- **Gross margin: S$52/year (43%)**

**Blended 3-year LTV** (device + 3 years subscription)
- Total revenue: S$270 + (S$120 × 3) = **S$630**
- Total cost: S$160 + (S$68 × 3) = **S$364**
- **Gross profit: S$266 (42% margin)**

### Path to profitability

- **Kickstarter phase** (100–200 devices): Use refurbished devices (S$80 COGS) to minimize capital lock-up
- **School pilot** (30–50 devices): Mix of refurbished + donated devices
- **Commercial launch** (500+ devices): Transition to new devices (S$150 COGS) for quality consistency
- **Target**: Break-even at ~500 devices; profitable at 1,000+ devices

---

## Slide 11 — Go-to-market (hybrid strategy)

We pursue a **dual-track approach**: B2C Kickstarter + School Pilot

### Phase 1: B2C Kickstarter Launch (Months 1–3)

**Objective**: Validate consumer demand and fund device inventory

**Positioning**: "The school-friendly phone Singapore parents have been asking for"
- Emphasize parent control, graduated autonomy, safe communication
- Soft mention of school compliance (not hero feature yet)

**Target**:
- 100–200 backers
- S$70K–S$110K in pre-orders
- **Kickstarter pricing**:
  - **Early Bird** (50 units): S$299 (device + 6-month subscription) — 11% discount
  - **Standard** (100 units): S$349 (device + 1-year subscription) — S$270 device + S$79 value
  - **Premium** (50 units): S$449 (device + 2-year subscription + premium case) — best value

**Why Kickstarter first**:
- Proven playbook (WisePhone raised $500K+; Sage launched DTC successfully)
- Fast revenue validation (3–4 months vs. 6–9 months for school partnerships)
- Builds parent community for school pilot recruitment
- Funds device inventory (reduces VC dilution)

---

### Phase 2: School Pilot Program (Months 3–6, parallel to Kickstarter fulfillment)

**Objective**: Build school partnerships and validate compliance model

**Positioning**: "We have 200 parents using FutureNet; now we want your school's input"
- Leverage Kickstarter backers as proof of parent demand
- Co-design school compliance features with 1–2 partner schools
- Offer free pilot devices and dedicated support

**Pilot cohort**:
- **Kickstarter backers** (20–30 families): Already using FutureNet, opt-in to school pilot
- **New families** (10–20 families): Recruited through school, receive free pilot devices

**Success metrics**:
- >95% devices remain policy-compliant during school hours
- >98% school-days School Mode activates as expected
- School endorsement letter: "We recognize FutureNet Phone as compliant with our device policy"

**Why school pilot second**:
- Schools see existing parent demand (de-risks their endorsement)
- Can iterate on school features without delaying B2C launch
- Kickstarter backers become school pilot participants (dual validation)

---

### Phase 3: Relaunch with School Endorsement (Months 6–9)

**Objective**: Scale with differentiated positioning (school-approved)

**Positioning upgrade**: "Now officially endorsed by [School Name] and [School Name]"
- Hero feature: School compliance + verification
- Launch Edusave-eligible pricing tier
- Target mainstream parents (not just early adopters)

**Go-to-market channels**:
- **School partnerships**: Distribute compliance verifier to 5–10 schools
- **DTC**: Continue online sales with school endorsement as trust signal
- **Edusave pathway**: Work with MOE to enable Edusave payments

**Target**:
- 500–1,000 devices deployed by Month 9
- 5–10 school partnerships
- S$200K–S$400K revenue run-rate

---

## Slide 12 — Why hybrid works (dual validation)

**Advantages of hybrid approach**:

1. **Faster revenue validation**
   - Kickstarter: 3–4 months to first revenue
   - School-only: 6–9 months to first revenue

2. **Reduced VC dilution**
   - Hybrid: S$250K VC + S$100K Kickstarter = S$350K total capital
   - School-only: S$350K VC (higher dilution)

3. **Dual validation de-risks both channels**
   - B2C (Kickstarter): Validates consumer willingness to pay
   - B2B2C (Schools): Validates institutional endorsement and compliance model
   - If one channel underperforms, the other provides fallback

4. **Stronger investor narrative**
   - "We have 200 paying customers AND 2 school partnerships" = dual traction
   - Positions for seed round with multiple growth paths

5. **Maintains differentiation**
   - Phase 1: "School-friendly" (soft positioning)
   - Phase 3: "School-approved" (hard positioning after pilot)
   - Best of both worlds: consumer traction + institutional moat

---

## Slide 13 — Competition

**Alternatives today**:

- **Mainstream smartphones + Screen Time / Family Link**
  - Often bypassable; high parent effort; not school-verifiable
  
- **"Healthy smartphone" products (US/UK)**
  - WisePhone, Sage: Proven demand, but not SG-available or school-compliance-first
  - Limited availability in Singapore; not aligned to SG school policy wedge
  
- **Trackers / watches**
  - Don't solve teen needs for a real phone (calls, logistics)

**Our differentiator**:
- **Phase 1–2**: Singapore-first, Android-based, parent-owned, strong enforcement
- **Phase 3**: Only school-approved, Edusave-eligible device in Singapore market

---

## Slide 14 — Defensibility (moat)

**Near-term moat**:
- **Distribution wedge**: School compliance + verifier + templates
- **Operational moat**: Provisioning + policy hardening + support playbooks
- **Community moat**: Kickstarter backers become advocates and school pilot participants

**Long-term moat**:
- **Institutional moat**: School partnerships (hard for competitors to replicate)
- **Data moat**: Anonymized compliance + exception patterns to improve School Mode design
- **Financial moat**: Edusave integration (competitors can't easily access)
- **Product moat**: "Graduated access" system across ages + approved-app ecosystem governance

---

## Slide 15 — Risks and mitigations

**Risk 1: Kickstarter campaign underperforms (<100 backers)**
- **Mitigation**: Pre-launch email list building (500–1,000 subscribers), early bird pricing, influencer partnerships
- **Contingency**: Extend campaign or pivot to pre-order model on own website

**Risk 2: Schools decline to participate in pilot**
- **Mitigation**: Target 3–5 schools (need only 1–2 to commit), leverage Kickstarter traction as proof
- **Contingency**: Pivot to pure B2C model and defer school partnerships to Phase 3

**Risk 3: Execution complexity (managing two cohorts simultaneously)**
- **Mitigation**: Clear channel separation, stagger timelines (Kickstarter Month 3–4, school pilot Month 4–6)
- **Contingency**: Delay school pilot to Month 5–7 and focus on Kickstarter fulfillment first

**Risk 4: Policy variability across schools**
- **Mitigation**: School templates + verifier (flexible policy engine)

**Risk 5: Bypass attempts** (VPN, hidden browsers, resets)
- **Mitigation**: Device Owner + allowlist + re-enrollment + hardening

**Risk 6: Support load**
- **Mitigation**: Limit device models, keep v1 app list minimal, build support automation

---

## Slide 16 — Team

We are a Singapore-based team of 3 co-founders:

- **2 Software Engineers**: Strong on secure systems, product engineering, and operational tooling
- **1 Solutions Engineer**: Experience with enterprise device management and customer success

**Why we can execute**:
